## Data and images are coming from the TMDB, all credits goes to them

### Demo: https://cinematics-tmdb.netlify.app/

#### Possible improvements:
- Better color pallet and overall UX/UI
- Better accessibility
- ErrorBoundary Component
- in order not to lose state when switching between routes consider redux-toolkit for movies
- setting api key for every request or use axios (also would fix the custom fetch() call in Movies.tsx)
- make HOC for <Provider /> for *test.tsx files
- add movie trailers
- e2e tests if needed
